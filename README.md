#Assignment
As I am now the assignment is still not fully finished. There is some issues, that whenever I try to do depth five graph querry the docker just shutsdown the container and I have to delete it and run a new one to make the database work again. Also, for some odd reason the id from the Graph are now working I am getting nulls. On the other hand just by running to depth 4 I can already say that Graph is way quicker in performing this action. With some name SQL take forever to even go through the second depth. I can not display any of the output because I constantly get one error after another with the docker issue. How the whole code is in the rep, so feel free to look at it.
